                      RTP/SDP for Opus Multistream
                raft-shin-avtcore-rtp-multi-opus-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies RTP/SDP signaling for Opus multistream
   (multi-channel) operation, enabling negotiation of layouts such as
   5.1 and 7.1 in real-time communications.  It defines an SDP encoding
   name and format parameters to describe multistream configurations,
   and specifies Offer/Answer procedures for interoperable negotiation.
   This document extends the Opus RTP payload format defined in RFC 7587
   and reuses the channel-mapping concepts defined for the Ogg container
   in RFC 7845.

1.  Introduction

   Opus (RFC 6716) supports up to 255 channels via multistream with
   explicit channel mapping.  The RTP payload format for Opus (RFC
   7587), however, standardizes only mono/stereo signaling for RTP/SDP
   and leaves multistream out of scope.  RFC 7845 defines
   channel-mapping families for Opus carried in the Ogg container, but
   it does not define RTP/SDP signaling or Offer/Answer behavior.  This
   document fills that gap by specifying interoperable SDP signaling and
   Offer/Answer procedures for multistream Opus in RTP sessions, while
   aligning channel-mapping semantics with RFC 7845.

2.  Relationship to Existing RFCs

   This section summarizes the scope and relationship between RFC 6716
   (Opus codec), RFC 7587 (Opus over RTP), RFC 7845 (Ogg encapsulation
   of Opus), and this draft.  While RFC 7845 defines channel mapping
   families for multistream Opus in the Ogg container, it does not
   define SDP signaling or RTP usage.  RFC 7587 defines the RTP payload
   format for Opus but only covers mono/stereo signaling.  This draft
   extends RFC 7587 to define SDP signaling for multistream Opus in RTP
   sessions and reuses the mapping semantics from RFC 7845.

5.  Overview and Rationale

   Deployed systems (e.g., libwebrtc-based) interoperate using a
   non-standard SDP encoding name “multiopus” with fmtp parameters such
   as num_streams, coupled_streams, and channel_mapping.  Standardizing
   these semantics improves interoperability and removes the need for
   application-level SDP text modifications.
